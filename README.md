# quick overview:

This Cordova plugin is for integration of the Trustly (Pay With My Bank) product with our B2B and Stardust customers.

Presently there is an Android implementation.   For the iOS implementation, see capacitor-plugin-paywithmybank.    
That project will soon be refactored and incorporated into this project.
